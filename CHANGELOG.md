# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Backend

- Added `POST /api/exams/{id}/questions/import` for Teacher/Admin question import from `.csv`, `.xlsx`, `.txt`, `.docx`, and text-based `.pdf` files.
- Added all-or-nothing import validation for file size, supported extension, content type, required columns, `question_type`, `correct_answer`, and `score` before saving questions.
- Added official Teacher/Admin import template listing and download APIs: `GET /api/exams/question-import/templates` and `GET /api/exams/question-import/templates/{fileName}`.
- Standardized the backend-hosted teacher template set to 20 no-accent file names across four question types and five supported formats.
- Added `short_answer` import support where `correct_answer` becomes the accepted sample answer; unsupported `essay`, legacy Office formats, ZIP/media imports, and scanned PDFs remain rejected.

### Frontend

- Teacher-facing Exam Management now uses an explicit draft-to-publish workflow instead of a publish checkbox; exam detail shows publish readiness, backend publish errors, a dedicated publish action, and complete question-type statistics for the backend-supported exam model.
- Exam schedule inputs are now handled in Vietnam time (`UTC+7`) on the frontend while requests still go to the backend in UTC, reducing timezone drift between create/edit and detail screens.
- Teacher question forms now explain the validation rules for single-choice, multiple-choice, true/false, and short-answer items so the publish checklist is easier to satisfy before release.
- Fixed the local Vite development proxy to target the backend HTTP profile on port `5157`, with `VITE_DEV_API_TARGET` available for overrides.

### Docs

- Added teacher-facing question import template documentation and usage guidance under `docs/10_QUESTION_BANK_IMPORT_TEMPLATES.md` and `docs/11_QUESTION_IMPORT_TEMPLATE_USAGE.md`.
- Added DOCX/PDF teacher import guide files with no-accent names under `docs/`.
- Clarified that `CHANGELOG.md` is the main project changelog and `docs/project-changelog.md` remains the detailed feature history.

### Fixed

- Fixed Swagger/OpenAPI generation for multipart question import by binding the uploaded file through a form model.
- Fixed tabular import parsing for CSV/XLSX templates that contain title or instruction rows before the real header row, and ignored trailing note rows.
- Fixed DOCX import parsing so Word line breaks in table cells are preserved.
- Fixed text-based PDF template parsing by decoding `/ToUnicode` CMap hex text operators.
- Synced local frontend dependencies after merging release changes so the merged `tw-animate-css` import builds correctly again.

### Known risks

- PDF import supports text-based PDFs only; scanned/image PDFs still require OCR and are not supported.
- The production frontend upload UI for browsing templates and displaying row-level import errors is still pending.
- Uploaded import file names do not need to match template names, but the extension must match the actual file format so the backend selects the correct parser.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-10

Stable release promoted from `v1.1.0-rc.1` after RC validation (auth + classroom Swagger E2E).

### Added

- **Authentication API:** register, login, refresh-token, logout, `GET /api/auth/me`
- JWT Bearer + ASP.NET Identity; refresh token rotation/revoke
- `ApiResponse<T>` envelope (`CreateSuccess` / `CreateFailure`)
- **Classroom API:** `POST /api/classrooms`, `GET /api/classrooms`, `POST /api/classrooms/join`, `GET /api/classrooms/{id}/members`
- Domain entities: `ApplicationUser`, `RefreshToken`, `Classroom`, `ClassroomMember`
- EF Core migration `InitialIdentityAndClassroom`; role seed Admin/Teacher/Student
- FluentValidation for auth and classroom requests

### Changed

- `Program.cs`: Swagger Bearer security, FluentValidation, auth middleware
- `TestController` standardized to `ApiResponse` envelope

### Security

- Demo `Jwt:Key` in `appsettings.json` — override via User Secrets/env before non-local deploy
- Join codes are 6-character hex; rate limiting not yet implemented

### Known limitations

- No automated integration tests; manual Swagger E2E validated for this release
- `GET /api/classrooms/{id}` (classroom detail) deferred
- Members endpoint returns email for active members; tighten for production if needed

[1.1.0]: https://github.com/DatTran26/EduGuard/compare/v1.0.0...v1.1.0

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-10

### Added

- Backend scaffold: `EduGuard.Api`, `Domain`, `Application`, and `Infrastructure` projects (.NET 8)
- Frontend folder structure for auth, exams, classrooms, assignments, anti-cheat, and notifications
- Project documentation suite (`docs/01`–`08`), design tokens (`design.md`), and UI guidelines
- Deploy workflow guide with staging-to-production flow diagram
- Git governance: Husky hooks, branch policy, push/ship agent skills, and `Todo List.md`
- Sample `GET /WeatherForecast` API endpoint and Swagger in Development

### Changed

- Expanded root `README.md` with project overview and status table

### Security

- Pin `System.Text.Json` to address transitive advisory GHSA-8g4q-xg66-9fp4
- Remove authorization middleware until authentication is implemented (Phase 2)

### Known limitations (scaffold baseline)

- No automated test projects yet; Husky `npm test` runs an empty test solution
- No database, auth, SignalR, or runnable frontend app in this release
- Infrastructure packages (EF Core, Redis, Serilog) referenced but not wired in `Program.cs`
